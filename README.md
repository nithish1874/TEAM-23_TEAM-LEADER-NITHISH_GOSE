# Agentic AI to Manage Digital & AI Fatigue (2025 BIG ISSUE)

An agent-based AI system designed to reduce **digital overload, notification fatigue, and cognitive burnout** by intelligently filtering, prioritizing, and controlling what users see.

---

# Problem Statement

People today are overwhelmed by:

- Emails
- WhatsApp / Slack / Teams messages
- AI notifications
- Deadlines & reminders
- Too many tools and dashboards

This constant digital noise leads to **burnout, anxiety, loss of focus, and poor productivity**.

👉 Digital & AI fatigue is a **global 2025-scale problem** affecting individuals and organizations.

---

# Why Digital & AI Fatigue Is a 2025 Crisis

- Explosion of AI-generated notifications
- Remote & hybrid work culture
- Always-on communication expectations
- No intelligent attention control systems

**Human attention has become the bottleneck.**

---

# Vision

To build an **Agentic AI system that protects human attention**, acting like a personal *AI Chief of Staff* that decides:

> “What should I see now, later, or never?”

---

# Solution Overview

An **Agentic AI architecture** that:

- Filters incoming information
- Scores importance and urgency
- Understands user context
- Decides to **show / postpone / hide** information

No heavy ML.  
No black-box models.  
Just **clear, explainable agent logic**.

---

# Agentic AI Architecture

The system is composed of simple, cooperative agents:

---


---

# 🤖 Agents Description

## 1️⃣ Input Agent
**Purpose:** Data ingestion

- Reads emails, messages, tasks, notifications
- Normalizes all inputs into a standard format

---

## 2️⃣ Priority Agent
**Purpose:** Importance scoring

- Sender importance
- Keywords (urgent, ASAP, deadline)
- Historical relevance
- Task vs notification detection

Outputs a **priority score**.

---

## 3️⃣ Context Agent
**Purpose:** Situational awareness

- Time of day
- Calendar events
- Current workload
- Focus or meeting mode

Adds **urgency intelligence**.

---

## 4️⃣ Focus Agent
**Purpose:** Attention protection

Decides whether to:

- ✅ Show immediately
- ⏳ Postpone
- 🚫 Hide or batch later

Optimized for **deep work & mental health**.

---

## 5️⃣ Supervisor Agent
**Purpose:** Final decision authority

- Combines outputs from all agents
- Applies global rules
- Overrides decisions when necessary

Acts as the **AI Chief of Staff**.

---

# 🔁 System Workflow

1. Input arrives (email/message/task)
2. Input Agent parses data
3. Priority & Context Agents score importance and urgency
4. Focus Agent evaluates attention cost
5. Supervisor Agent makes final decision
6. Action executed (show, delay, hide)

---

# 🧠 Decision Logic (Simple & Explainable)

Example:



---

# ❌ Why Not Heavy ML?

- Hard to explain decisions
- Expensive infrastructure
- Unpredictable behavior
- Overkill for this problem

✅ **Agent logic is transparent, controllable, and efficient.**

---
